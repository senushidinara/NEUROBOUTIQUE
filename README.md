## ‚ú® Core Innovation: AI Simulation Engine

NeuroBoutique is more than a pharmacy. It‚Äôs a **predictive, personalized wellness platform**. Its innovation lies in combining **multi-modal tracking**, **AI-driven recommendations**, and **simulation-based predictive modeling**.

Two AI agents power the platform:

- **AI Recommender:** Analyzes sleep, focus, mood, and other metrics to select tailored product bundles.  
- **AI Simulator:** Forecasts week-by-week changes in cognitive, physical, and mood metrics, letting users **see potential outcomes** before purchasing.

Together, they answer:  
*"What will this purchase do for me?"*
