## ‚ú® Core Innovation: AI Simulation Engine

NeuroBoutique is not just a marketplace; it‚Äôs a **predictive, personalized wellness platform**. Its core innovation lies in combining **multi-modal user tracking**, **AI-driven recommendations**, and **simulation-based predictive modeling** to deliver personalized wellness plans.  

We achieve this with **two collaborating AI agents**:

- **AI Recommender:** This agent analyzes data from multiple sources ‚Äî including sleep patterns, activity levels, focus scores, and mood metrics ‚Äî to diagnose potential deficiencies. Based on this analysis, it selects a tailored product bundle designed specifically for the user‚Äôs goals.  
- **AI Simulator:** Once the recommended bundle is generated, the AI Simulator forecasts the week-by-week changes in cognitive, physical, and mood-related metrics. This allows users to **visualize the potential impact of their choices over time**.

Together, these agents answer the fundamental user question:  
*"What will this purchase do for me?"*

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup & Execution Guide (Google Colab MVP)

To simplify judging and execution, the entire **AI logic, data handling, and visualization** is packaged in a **single Google Colab Notebook**. This eliminates setup barriers and ensures anyone can experience the platform immediately.  

### Prerequisites
- A web browser  
- A Google Account (required to run code in Colab)

### Step-by-Step Demo Instructions
1. **Open the Notebook** in Google Colab.  
2. **Run All Cells:** Go to **Runtime ‚Üí Run all** in the top menu.  
3. **Observe Outputs:** The notebook demonstrates the full NeuroBoutique workflow:  
   - Multi-modal tracking of user metrics  
   - AI-driven personalized bundle recommendations  
   - Predictive simulations visualizing potential outcomes
