## ‚ú® Core Innovation: AI Simulation Engine

NeuroBoutique moves beyond simple recommendation by leveraging **two collaborating AI agents** to offer validated outcomes:

- **AI Recommender:** Analyzes multi-modal tracked data (Sleep Score, Focus Score, Mood) to diagnose deficiencies and select a tailored product bundle.  
- **AI Simulator:** Runs a predictive model to forecast the week-by-week cognitive and physical metric changes if the user follows the recommended products.  

This answers the fundamental user question:  
*"What will this purchase do for me?"*
