## ‚ú® Core Innovation: AI Simulation Engine

NeuroBoutique moves beyond simple recommendation by leveraging **two collaborating AI agents** to offer validated outcomes:

- **AI Recommender:** Analyzes tracked data (Sleep Score, Focus Score, Mood) to diagnose deficiencies and select a tailored product bundle.  
- **AI Simulator:** Runs a predictive model to forecast the week-by-week cognitive and physical metric changes if the user uses the recommended products.  

This answers the fundamental user question:  
*"What will this purchase do for me?"*

## üìà Demo Visualization: Predicted Outcomes

The core technical output is the **predicted metric increase visualized over time**.  

*(CRITICAL: Upload the chart image to `assets/demo_screenshot.png` and it will display here once the repo is live!)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup & Execution Guide (Google Colab MVP)

The entire AI logic, data handling, and visualization are contained in the **`neuroboutique_demo.py`** script, ensuring zero setup time for judging.

### Prerequisites
- A web browser  
- A Google Account (required to run code in Colab)

### üöÄ Step-by-Step Demo Instructions

Follow these steps to experience the complete personalized wellness flow:

1. **Launch the Script in Colab**  
   - Go to the Google Colab environment and upload the `neuroboutique_demo.py` file.  
   - Alternatively, open a new notebook and paste the contents of `neuroboutique_demo.py` into the first code cell.  

2. **Install Dependencies (If needed)**  
   Run this command in a code cell if using a fresh Colab instance:  
   ```python
   !pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. **Execute the Code**  
   - Run all cells (or execute the single cell containing the script).

### üîç Expected Output (3 Key Feature Demos)

Observe the console output and generated chart:

- **Multi-Modal Tracking:** Initial printout confirms the user's low focus score (e.g., Focus Score: 0.35).  
- **AI Personalized Bundle:** Console shows Auto-Optimization messages (e.g., "Sub-optimal sleep detected. Adding SleepSync Eye Mask.") followed by the final recommended product list.  
- **AI Simulation:** Generates a **line chart** showing predicted trends for Focus, Sleep, and Mood metrics over time, followed by the final projected scores in the console.
